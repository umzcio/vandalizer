"""Anonymous deployment telemetry — the once-daily heartbeat.

This is the privacy-first "how many deployments exist and roughly how heavily
are they used" signal for self-hosted Vandalizer. It is OPT-IN: nothing leaves
the box unless an admin sets both ``telemetry_enabled=True`` and a
``telemetry_endpoint`` (see ``app.config.Settings``).

What the heartbeat sends:
  - a stable random instance UUID (generated here, persisted in Mongo; it is not
    derived from anything identifying and cannot be reversed to an institution)
  - the running version and a coarse environment ("production" / "other")
  - usage as COARSE BUCKETS only ("11-50", never an exact count)

What it never sends: document content, filenames, titles, user identities,
emails, API keys, team names, or any free text. The payload is a fixed,
auditable shape — see ``build_heartbeat_payload`` — and every send is logged
locally when ``telemetry_log_payload`` is on, so an admin can read exactly what
was transmitted.

Sync (pymongo + httpx.Client) because it runs from a Celery beat task.
