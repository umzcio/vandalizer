This is both why it\'s capable and why it makes mistakes.\n\nIt\'s capable because human language follows patterns. A grant proposal has a predictable structure: PI name, institution, budget, aims. The LLM has seen thousands of similar documents and can reliably identify these patterns.\n\nIt makes mistakes because pattern-matching is not understanding. The LLM doesn\'t know what a budget is.
